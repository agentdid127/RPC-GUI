# Resource Pack Converter GUI
## Update: As of v2.0, the source for this has moved to agentdid127/ResourcePackConverter. You can still download the finished project from here as of now.
### Current version: 2.0.1

This is a software that allows you to use the Resource Pack Converter with a GUI.

Since this is brand new, utilities aren't completely there yet, but you'll be able to do much more soon!


Of course, as this is open-source, feel free to submit any PRs to any feature additions/bugfixes
### Features:
- Basic Conversion to any newer version
- Minifying resource packs (This limits the file size for the pack)
- Console Output

### Known Bugs:
- None yet, Please submit issues on Github

### Features to be added:
- 1.15 Light Changes
- I'd like to have a cleaner GUI in the future, but this is my first GUI app using swing, so that's for another developer or another time.
